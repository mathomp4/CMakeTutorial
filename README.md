# CMake Tutorial

This is a set of basic CMake tutorial code. There are currently two examples

## Basic

This is a simple Fortran code that calculates matrix multiplication. It is a simple example to show how to use CMake to build a
Fortran code with three lines of CMake code.

## Hello world

This is a more complex example of an MPI Hello World code. It shows how to use CMake to build a code that uses MPI and optionally
OpenMP. It also uses many of the features of CMake such as finding external libraries, building our own libraries, etc.
